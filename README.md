# Custom Compiler - High-Level Machine Code to Executable

## Description
This project is a fully functional compiler written in C++ that processes high-level machine code written in a custom language, which is syntactically similar to Java. The compiler is designed to take the source code through various stages including tokenization, parsing, syntax and logic error checking, and finally code generation. The generated machine code is then interpreted and executed by a custom Java interpreter.

## Features
- **Tokenizer**: 
  - The compiler breaks down the input code into individual tokens, which are the smallest meaningful elements of the language (such as keywords, operators, identifiers, etc.).
- **Parser**: 
  - The tokens are processed to create a full parse tree that represents the syntactic structure of the code. This stage ensures that the code conforms to the grammar rules of the language.
- **Syntax and Logical Error Checking**: 
  - During the parsing phase, the compiler checks for syntax errors and certain logical errors to ensure that the code is valid before proceeding to the next stage.
- **Code Generator**: 
  - Once the parse tree is validated, the compiler generates low-level machine code in a custom intermediate language. This machine code can then be passed to the Java-based interpreter for execution.
- **Java Interpreter**: 
  - The generated machine code is processed and run by a Java interpreter, simulating execution of the compiled code.

## Components
- **Compiler**: Written in C++ and responsible for tokenizing, parsing, and generating machine code from the custom language.
- **Interpreter**: A Java-based system that reads the machine code generated by the compiler and simulates the program's execution.



## Workflow
1. **Tokenization**: The compiler reads the high-level code and converts it into tokens.
2. **Parsing**: The tokens are arranged into a parse tree, which checks the syntactical structure of the code.
3. **Error Checking**: The parser ensures that the code is free of syntax and logical errors.
4. **Code Generation**: The compiler generates machine code, which is output in a format that can be interpreted by the Java interpreter.
5. **Execution**: The generated machine code is interpreted and run using the Java interpreter.
